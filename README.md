Our Universe is a Simulation? - The Riddle of Time and Space

Are we living in a real world? How we define real and differentiate it from fiction or simulation?It is still a mystery that how this universe was modeled and why we are here. We may be wondering;Are we older than our universe or contrary to it. Physics says matter cannot be created nor destroyed, which mean we have same age as our universe. Different dissident from scientific mind to religious has different opinion over this issue. Both have the justification to validate their opinion.
We define real things which we can touch, Smell, taste and hear. But this is not an absolute definition   and we need to understand the mechanism that how our mind perceives information about real things. When we touch something our body create stream of electrical signal which are transformed by brain to createimages. But what if we create these signals virtually in same pattern, and fed it to brain, then we can start feeling things what we like to do and can create our own universe. Likewise human may communicate with each other simply using brain signals thousand miles away without any electronics instrument.
If we and the universe exist then question is whether this is all real or just part of simulation  of a complex mathematical model running inside a computer chip, like a computer video game, like a dream where everything seem to be real as long as we remain in dream state. In a dream we cannot distinguish whether we are awaken or in dream.
 Assuming that this world is not a real then we are most probably plugged and controlled from somewhereelse where every of our action has been pre defined prior to running of this(universe) simulation  similar to a computer program where we define variable and constant etc. But how much freedom do we have while virtually living inside a tiny computorchip. We can hear voice of certain magnitude and frequency and beyond which our eyes fail to transform these signal into real information. Wecannot, seebeyond certain distance, smell and similarly taste. Itmeans we are living in Matrix/cage, like a slave beyond which we cannot see,hear,smell and taste whereevents are controlled by reference clock, the universal time. The universe is shrouded by two dimensional sheet call time and space andwe cannot escape from this barrier of time and space. Once we succeed we may be able to go back and forth in time. A person may able to enjoy the past events of childhood or may jump to see future, defyinggravity.
 But so far we have not flourished to do so because of strong dependencies on these universal parameters like Gravity, Time and space and we may not be able to do so as we are tightlybound  like a fix computer program which we may call Fate. Dissidents -with opinion that this universe is real-may be  thinking and to convince themselves that certain factor changes the outcome ,while living in this universe, makingthem to believethat they can change the outcome(fate). It has same analogy like a computer program where  changing certain inputs lead to change the output  but program is still bound to specific range of inputs and would yield a particular set of outputs. This depict that living inside this universe we got some freedom to change things but strongly bound to some fixed factors mapped to specific results (outputs).
Can we can escape from this modeled universe (Simulation)? .We tried to dig out the answer fromMuslim holy book (The Quran) in Surah Ar-Rahman ayat 33:O company of jinn(Ghost) and mankind, if you are able to pass beyond the regions of the heavens and the earth, then pass. You will not pass except by authority (bisultan).
The truth about the reality and virtuality of the universe, the riddle of time and space are still unsolved mysteries and let hope that further future advancement in science and technology would one day lead us to solve these mysterious questions.
